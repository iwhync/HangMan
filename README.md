# HangMan
Working, yet basic hangman game with around 800 words and some sounds.

Yes - The words stored as a ist look absolutely dreadful.
I've posted this solely because I wanted to use the --onefile tag and i couldn't reference from a text file.
There's probably others like me who had some trouble just finding a list of suitable hangman words, so use them if you need to!!
